        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <p>Juno Teo Minh, the first human born on Mars, grew up in a scientific colony working on Project Red Promise. 
            Despite being isolated, she was curious and adventurous, often venturing outside in a makeshift suit. 
            With the support of the colony, she became a skilled navigator, embodying the hope of humanityâ€™s future on Mars.
            <br><br>
            As Mars faced dangerous dust storms from the terraforming project, the Red Promise team realized they were running out of time. 
            With no help from Earth, they decided to send Juno to seek assistance. After an emotional farewell, she left Mars with climate data, 
            overcoming technical malfunctions along the way.
            <br><br>
            On Earth, Juno was overwhelmed by new cultures but remained determined to save her family. She struggled to adjust but found support 
            from Mei, a climatologist who knew her mother. Amidst Earth's conflict, Juno stayed focused on her mission, continuing to search for 
            a way to help Mars.</p>
